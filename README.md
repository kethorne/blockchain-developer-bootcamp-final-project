# Medicare Insurance Review

# The Problem
Insurance companies have to review patient records in doctor’s offices and hospitals across the country. Most outsource this task by hiring another company to collect the information. This requires sending an individual to the doctor’s offices and hospitals to collect patient information pertinent to medicare review. They are checking to make sure that the doctor’s offices and hospitals are following medicare guidelines that have been implemented by the government. If the doctor’s offices and hospitals are in violation they risk losing the ability to accept medicare payments.

# The Goal
The goal is to have a place where doctor’s offices and hospitals can upload the patient information for review and allow the insurance companies to pull the information. Ideally, all of the doctors of the patient will have the same information and be able compare charts to make sure they are not prescribing against another doctor so that there is one file the insurance company has to pull instead of multiple files.

# How can this be achieved?
The insurance companies have a list that the doctors and hospitals need to check off. The form would need to cross check diagnoses  from the doctors and hospitals to make sure there were no conflicts. If there are no conflicts the charts from the doctor or hospital could be uploaded. If there were conflicts they would need to confer and come to an agreement to solve the conflict. The insurance company could then retrieve the patient information for review and continue the medicare payments to the doctors and hospitals
